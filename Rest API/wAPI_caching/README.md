# Integration Layer for Weather Application

## Introduction
The purpose of this report is to provide a comprehensive analysis of an integration layer designed and built to mediate requests between a mobile application and the OpenWeatherMap API. This application aims to address the challenges posed by rate limits set by the third-party API, which can be a bottleneck, especially when the client app gains popularity. We'll dissect the architectural choices, understand the flow of the code, and evaluate the design decisions made during the development process.

## Architectural Overview

The application follows a standard Express-based architecture. The organization adheres to best practices by segregating functionalities into folders and files based on their specific responsibilities:

- **/__tests__**: Contains unit tests.
- **/controllers**: Handles incoming HTTP requests and sends appropriate responses.
- **/routes**: Manages routing of the application.
- **/utils**: A collection of utility functions, including weather data fetching and logging.
- **app.js**: Initializes and bootstraps the application.
- **config.js**: Manages configurations.
- **redisClient.js**: Manages the connection to the Redis server.
- **.env**: Keeps environment-specific configurations.

## Code Explanation

1. **app.js**: The heart of the application, `app.js` is where the server is initiated. It starts by importing necessary dependencies, sets up middleware to handle JSON inputs, routes through `/weather`, and provides an error handling middleware. The `bootstrapApp()` function ensures that the Redis client is ready before starting the server. Only if not in a test environment, the server is bootstrapped.

2. **weatherRoutes.js**: This file defines two routes for weather data retrieval - `/summary` and `/cities/:city_id`. Each route points to its respective controller function.

3. **weatherController.js**: This file has two main functions:
   - `getWeatherSummary()`: Fetches weather data for multiple cities and filters the data to return only cities where the temperature exceeds a specified value.
   - `getCityWeather()`: Retrieves the weather data for a single city for the next five days.

4. **weatherUtils.js**: This utility file manages interactions with the OpenWeatherMap API. The core function, `fetchWeatherData()`, first checks if the request exceeds the API rate limit, then attempts to retrieve cached data from Redis, and if not available, fetches data from the API, caches it in Redis, and increments an API counter.  

5. **redisClient.js**: This module initializes the Redis client, manages connection events (like connect, ready, and error), and provides a utility function to wait until the Redis client is ready.

6. **.env**: Holds environment-specific configurations, specifically the API key for OpenWeatherMap.

7. **logger.js**: Provides a consistent logging mechanism using the `winston` library. It separates logs into error logs and combined logs and provides a colorized console output for non-production environments.

8. **allTests.js**: Contains the tests for the application. It mocks certain functions to avoid actual HTTP requests or Redis interactions. Before all tests, it ensures the Redis client is ready and starts the Express server on a different port. After all tests, it closes the server and Redis connection.

## Design Decisions

1. **Integration Layer**: Instead of direct API calls from the mobile app to OpenWeatherMap, an integration layer is introduced, offering a buffer and a caching mechanism to ensure rate limits aren't exceeded.

2. **Redis for Caching**: Redis is used to cache weather data. This reduces the number of calls made to OpenWeatherMap and ensures faster response times for frequently requested data.

3. **API Rate Limiting**: An `api_counter` in Redis tracks the number of API calls made to OpenWeatherMap. Before any request, the counter is checked to ensure it doesn't exceed the defined limit.

4. **Modularity and Clean Code**: The codebase follows a modular approach, promoting separation of concerns. This ensures that any expansion or modification in the future remains seamless.

5. **Error Handling**: Both client-side and server-side errors are efficiently handled. They're also logged to provide insights into any issues the application might encounter.

6. **Testing**: The app's testability is considered in its design. By mocking certain functions in tests, it ensures that unit tests don't make actual API calls or alter the database.

## Conclusion

In this report, we analyzed the integration layer developed as a solution for the backend technical take-home challenge provided by Shape. The solution effectively buffers and manages requests to the OpenWeatherMap API, ensuring the rate limit isn't exceeded while also providing fast response times through caching. The modular and scalable code structure promises easy maintenance and potential expansion in the future.
